Write Only
==========

The OpenAPI :samp:`writeOnly` directive is interpreted by OpenAlchemy that the
column will not be returned when the model is converted to a dictionary.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`write-only`
      OpenAlchemy documentation for the writeOnly value.

The following example defines that :samp:`passport_number` for :samp:`Employee`
should not be returned by the server:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/write_only/example-spec.yml
    :language: yaml
    :linenos:

The following file uses OpenAlchemy to generate the SQLAlchemy models:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/write_only/models.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

The SQLAlchemy models generated by OpenAlchemy are equivalent to the following
traditional models file:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/write_only/models_traditional.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

OpenAlchemy will generate the following typed models:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/write_only/models_auto.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
