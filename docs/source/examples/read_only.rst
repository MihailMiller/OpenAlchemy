Read Only
=========

The OpenAPI :samp:`readOnly` directive is interpreted by OpenAlchemy that the
column may not be present for construction (which means that it is either
:samp:`null` or generated by the server).

.. seealso::

    :ref:`read-only`
      OpenAlchemy documentation for the readOnly value.

The following example defines that :samp:`id` cannot be passed to the server
for an :samp:`Employee` object:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/read_only/example-spec.yml
    :language: yaml
    :linenos:

The following file uses OpenAlchemy to generate the SQLAlchemy models:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/read_only/models.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

The SQLAlchemy models generated by OpenAlchemy are equivalent to the following
traditional models file:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/read_only/models_traditional.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

OpenAlchemy will generate the following typed models:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/read_only/models_auto.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
