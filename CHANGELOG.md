# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add support for namespaced `x-open-alchemy-` prefix on top of the shorter
  `x-` prefix for extension properties.

## [v2.0.2] - 2020-12-19

### Changed

- Changed from `setup.py` to poetry

## [v2.0.1] - 2020-12-08

### Added

- Add version, title and description (if defined) into the JSON OpenAPI
  specification stored with the package generated by the build module.

## [v2.0.0] - 2020-11-15

### Added

- Add check enforcing unique `x-tablename` values. [#189]
- Add check enforcing unique `x-secondary` values. [#189]
- Add custom association schemas validation [#189]
- Add support for custom association tables [#189]
- Add `openalchemy` CLI with a first sub command to build a Python package
  from a specification file. [#201]
- Add a CLI sub command to regenerate models. [#202]
- Add support for database default values using `x-server-default`. [#196]

### Changed

- Change the association table to no longer be noted on the models based on
  the `x-secondary` value and instead be noted based on converting the
  `x-secondary` value from snake_case to PascalCase. Name clashes are avoided
  by pre-pending `Autogen` as many times as required. [#189]
- Change the association table to no longer be constructed as a table and
  instead to be constructed as another model. [#189]
- Refactor column factory to use the schemas artifacts [#196]
- Refactor model factory to use the schemas artifacts [#196]

### Fixed

- Fix bug where the association table defined for `many-to-many` relationships
  did not make the foreign key columns referencing the two sides of the
  relationship primary keys. _This may require a database migration if alembic
  was used to generate the database schema._ [#189]
- Fix bug where some properties were incorrectly picked from a reference even
  though they existed locally (only impacts relationship properties where, for
  example, `x-secondary` was defined both on the relationship property in
  `allOf` and on the referenced model). [#189]

### Removed

- Remove `define_all` parameter for `init_model_factory`, `init_json` and
  `init_yaml`. OpenAlchemy now behaves as though `define_all` is set to
  `True`. _This means that a pure model reference (a schema with only the
  `$ref` key) can no longer be used to change the name of a model._ [#189]

## [v1.6.0] - 2020-10-10

### Added

- Add `build_json` and `build_yaml` interfaces which can be used to produce a
  package with the models. [#190]
- Add support for building sdist or wheel distributable archive.

### Changed

- Refactor the models file generation to use the artifacts from the schemas.
- Changed output of build_json and build_yaml to be contained within a project
  directory.
- Drop support for Python 3.6 and add support for Python 3.9. [#198]

## [v1.5.4] - 2020-08-30

### Changed

- Move `description` to be a top level property artifact for every property.

## [1v.5.3] - 2020-08-29

### Fixed

- Correct `format` key to no longer have a trailing `_` for artifacts.

## [v1.5.2] - 2020-08-29

### Changed

- Expose function that collects artifacts for the models.
- Expose function that collects artifacts for the model properties.

## [v1.5.1] - 2020-08-23

### Added

- Add support for arbitrary mix in classes.

## [v1.5.0] - 2020-08-22

### Added

- Add support for generic `format` for `string` that are treated like a
  `string` without a `format`.
- Add interface to check un-managed models for the reason why they are not
  managed.

### Changed

- Change constructable check to no longer check the schema of `x-tablename`
  and `x-inherits`.
- Change schema validation to process properties even if the model is not
  valid.
